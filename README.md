# Hello! :wave:

My name is Thomas and I have enjoyed technology and engineering from childhood. I grew up voiding warranties by trying to fix the family VCR to now learning the latest technologies. I enjoy building and integrating systems into an efficient workflow that is adaptable.

I am always looking for colleagues to share knowledge and experiences with. We are all both teachers and learners in the vast scope of being an Information Technology professional.
