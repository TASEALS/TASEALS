# Hello! :wave:

I'm Thomas, I have enjoyed technology and engineering from childhood. Grew up voiding waranties trying to fix the family VCR to now learning the latest technologies like Kubernetes. I enjoy building and integrating them into an effecient workflow that is adaptible.

I am always searching for new collegues to learn and to educate. We are all teachers and learners in the vast scope of being an Information Technology professional.
